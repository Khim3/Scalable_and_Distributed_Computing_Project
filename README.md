# Stock Price Forecasting System using Apache Spark

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a stock price forecasting system for Netflix, designed to assist in making data-driven investment decisions. By leveraging Apache Spark for distributed computing and advanced machine learning models, the system analyzes historical stock data and predicts future prices. 

The project incorporates linear regression, decision tree regression, and LSTM models to benchmark performance and identify the best model for forecasting. A Streamlit-based user interface (UI) has been developed to load pre-trained models, test them on provided test files, and visualize the results with actual vs. predicted plots.

## Limitations
- **Data Quality:** The accuracy of stock price forecasting is highly dependent on the quality of historical data and the assumptions made during preprocessing.
- **Model Selection:** The choice of forecasting model can significantly impact the accuracy of predictions, and different models may perform better under different conditions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** While metrics such as MAE and RMSE provide insights into model performance, they may not capture all aspects of forecasting accuracy.
- **User Interface:** The Streamlit-based UI provides basic functionality for loading models and testing on test files but could be further enhanced with additional features.
- **Data Limitations:** The forecasting system is limited to historical stock data for Netflix (only for 5 years) and may not generalize well to other stocks or financial instruments.

## Future Work

- **Model Tuning:** Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to improve the accuracy of forecasting models.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Explore the use of ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting to combine multiple models for better predictions.
- **Additional Features:** Enhance the Streamlit UI with additional features such as real-time data updates, custom model training, and more advanced visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the forecasting system to a cloud platform such as AWS or GCP to make it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Test with more models**: Test with more models to find the best model for forecasting stock price.
